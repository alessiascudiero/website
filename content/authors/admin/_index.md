I am a fourth-year Economics Ph.D. candidate at Emory University. My research interests include Macroeconometrics and Applied Macroeconomics, with a special focus on Monetary Policy. <br />
I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Turin, Italy with a bachelor's degree in Business Economics (2017) and a dual Master's degree in Economics (University of Turin) and International Public Finance (University of Rennes 1, France). <br />
Prior to starting my PhD program at Emory, I worked as a trainee in the Monetary Analysis division of the European Central Bank. <br />
In the summer of 2024, I visited the Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland as an American Economic Association (AEA) Summer Fellow.
