I am a rising third-year Economics Ph.D. student at Emory University. My research interests include Macroeconometrics, Applied Macroeconomics, Monetary Policy and Time Series Analysis. I am also an alumna of Università degli studi di Torino, where I graduated with both a bachelor's degree in Business Economics (2017) and a double Master's degree in Economics and International Public Finance (2019) jointly with the Université de Rennes 1. My professional experience includes a traineeship in the Monetary Analysis division of the European Central Bank and an internship in the risk management department of a financial asset management company.
